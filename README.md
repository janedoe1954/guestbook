# Guestbook

A simple guestbook using plain old PHP, MySQL, Bootstrap and jQuery. 

I've created this a few years ago for holding a course about web development.
Please feel free to use it for learning or teaching purposes.

Small note: The methodologies and technologies used in this guestbook are not considered as state-of-the-art and partitially reflecting outdated standards. Though, for learning how to build a simple framework based web app it should be fine.
